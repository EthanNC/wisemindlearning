### Shade-grown coffee
Dr. Krishnan completed her training as a School Psychologist at Northeastern University in Boston, M.A.  Her pre-doctoral clinical training was completed at Newton South High School and UMass Memorial Hospital’s Outpatient Psychiatry Department, and her internship at Judge Baker Children’s Center, where she was a Fellow at Harvard Medical School.  She also has a Master’s degree in Learning Disorders from Northwestern University in Evanston, Il.  She has worked for over two decades with students, schools and families in the Boston area and is trained in a number of evidence-based programs including Wilson, Project Read and Orton Gillingham for reading, Empower for writing, and MATCH-ADTC, a manualized, evidence-based CBT protocol for treating anxiety, depression and disruptive behavior in children and adolescents.  

### Single origin
Previously, Dr. Krishnan  provided comprehensive evaluations to learners of all ages to delineate their learning profiles, and diagnose neurodevelopmental and mental health problems including learning disorders, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, anxiety and depression.  Currently, Dr. Krishnan provides highly specialized, individualized, and strategic support to learners with vulnerabilities in executive function, learning (reading, writing, study skills), as well as behavioral and emotional regulation. 

### Sustainable farming
She specializes in understanding the unique strengths and weaknesses of each individual learner, and in designing interventions that are specific to the learner.  She integrates information across cognitive, learning, behavioral and emotional functioning, using a developmentally and culturally informed framework, to arrive at comprehensive and holistic case conceptualizations.  Dr Krishnan employs evidence-based practices and treatments.  

### Direct sourcing
Dr. Krishnan is also a sought after trainer and speaker for both parent groups and faculty.  She has served as adjunct faculty at Tufts University and Northwestern University, and has presented at national and international conferences.  Her research interests include self-regulated learning, metacognition, learning disorders, and implementation science.  She approaches her research and practice from a humanistic, multicultural, and developmental orientation.
